      <h3>How do I suggest a new transmitter?</h3>
      <ul class="faq">
        <li>
          First you need to identify the satellite which carries the transmitter.
          Do that by searching on the main search field and selecting the satellite you would like
          to add a new transmitter in.

        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that the transmitter is not already listed under the satellite.
          Double check for other Modes that might include the information you would like to add.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the small plus icon on the upper right corner of the satellite.

      <h3>The satellite I am looking is not there.</h3>
      <ul class="faq">
        <li>
          Not all satellites are in SatNOGS DB yet. We prioritized the most common ones that we have
          transmitter information for. We need your help to expand our database!
        </li>
        <li>
              Go to our <a href="https://community.satnogs.org/c/software/db" target="_blank">Community Forum</a>
              and open a new thread requesting a satellite addition, with additional info
              (links and citations) about it.
        </li>
        <li>
          A DB reviewer will answer promptly and add the satellite to the DB so you can suggest
          transmitter information.
        </li>
      </ul>
